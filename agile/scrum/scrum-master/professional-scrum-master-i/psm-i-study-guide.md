Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.

### Key Principles:
- **Empiricism**: Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed
- **Lean Thinking**: Reduce waste and focus on the essentials
- **Self-Management**: Teams choose how best to accomplish their work
- **Cross-Functional**: Teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work

## Scrum Theory and Values

### Empirical Process Control
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory (empiricism), which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

```mermaid

    A[Transparency] --> B[Inspection]
    B --> C[Adaptation]
    C --> A
```

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Transparency**: The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work and those receiving the work
2. **Inspection**: The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently
3. **Adaptation**: If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted

### Scrum Values

    A[Commitment] --> B[Courage]
    B --> C[Focus]
    C --> D[Openness]
    D --> E[Respect]
    E --> A
```

1. **Commitment**: The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other
2. **Courage**: The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems
3. **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team
4. **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges
5. **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people

## Scrum Roles

### The Scrum Team

```mermaid

```

The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies.

### Product Owner
**Accountability**: Maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team

**Responsibilities:**
- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items
- Ordering Product Backlog items
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood

### Scrum Master
**Accountability**: Establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide and helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice

**Responsibilities:**
- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments
- Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team's progress
- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox

### Developers
**Accountability**: Creating a plan for the Sprint (Sprint Backlog), instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done, and adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal

**Responsibilities:**
- Creating a plan for the Sprint (Sprint Backlog)
- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal
- Holding each other accountable as professionals

## Scrum Events

### Sprint

    C --> B
    B --> D[Sprint Review]
    D --> E[Sprint Retrospective]
    E --> F[Next Sprint]
```

**Duration**: 1 month or less
**Purpose**: Container for all other events

### Sprint Planning
**Duration**: Maximum of 8 hours for a one-month Sprint
**Purpose**: Initiate the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed

**Topics Addressed:**
1. Why is this Sprint valuable?
2. What can be Done this Sprint?
3. How will the chosen work get done?

### Daily Scrum
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Purpose**: Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary

**Key Points:**
- For the Developers of the Scrum Team
- Held at the same time and place every working day
- Reduces complexity

### Sprint Review
**Duration**: Maximum of 4 hours for a one-month Sprint
**Purpose**: Inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations

**Activities:**
- Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders
- Progress toward the Product Goal is discussed
- Attendees collaborate on what to do next

### Sprint Retrospective
**Duration**: Maximum of 3 hours for a one-month Sprint
**Purpose**: Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness

**Focus Areas:**
- Individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and Definition of Done
- Most impactful improvements
- Ways to implement improvements

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
**Commitment**: Product Goal

An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

### Sprint Backlog
**Commitment**: Sprint Goal

Composed of the Sprint Goal, the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus an actionable plan for delivering the Increment.

### Increment
**Commitment**: Definition of Done

A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified.
