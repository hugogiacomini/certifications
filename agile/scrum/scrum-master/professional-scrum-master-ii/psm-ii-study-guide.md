    G[Nexus Sprint Planning] --> H[Nexus Daily Scrum]
    H --> I[Nexus Sprint Review]
    I --> J[Nexus Sprint Retrospective]
```

2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Use techniques like Five Whys or Fishbone diagrams
3. **Systemic Thinking**: Understand the system and its interconnections
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve the right people in solutions
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement small, incremental changes

## Practice Questions

### Question 1
**A Scrum Team is experiencing conflicts during Sprint Planning. As a Scrum Master, what is your best approach?**
A) Tell the team how to resolve the conflict
B) Facilitate a discussion to help the team understand different perspectives
C) Remove the conflicting team members from the meeting
D) Postpone Sprint Planning until the conflict is resolved

**Answer: B) Facilitate a discussion to help the team understand different perspectives**
*Explanation: As a servant leader and facilitator, the Scrum Master should help the team work through conflicts by facilitating understanding and communication, not by imposing solutions.*

### Question 2
**Your organization wants to measure team productivity using velocity. What should you advise?**
A) Velocity is an excellent productivity metric
B) Velocity should be used to compare teams
C) Velocity is useful for capacity planning but not for measuring productivity
D) Velocity should be tracked and reported to management weekly

**Answer: C) Velocity is useful for capacity planning but not for measuring productivity**
*Explanation: Velocity is a planning tool for the team to understand their capacity. It should not be used as a productivity metric or to compare teams, as this can lead to gaming and reduced quality.*

### Question 3
**A Product Owner is consistently unavailable for questions during the Sprint. What should the Scrum Master do?**
A) Answer the questions on behalf of the Product Owner
B) Have the team continue working without clarification
C) Help the Product Owner understand their accountability and the impact of their unavailability
D) Escalate to the Product Owner's manager

**Answer: C) Help the Product Owner understand their accountability and the impact of their unavailability**
*Explanation: The Scrum Master should coach and educate the Product Owner about their role and help them understand how their availability affects the team and product value.*

### Question 4
**Multiple Scrum Teams are working on the same product and experiencing integration issues. What is the best approach?**
A) Create a separate integration team
B) Implement the Nexus framework
C) Have teams work on completely independent features
D) Merge all teams into one large team

**Answer: B) Implement the Nexus framework**
*Explanation: Nexus is specifically designed to address integration challenges when multiple Scrum Teams work on the same product. It provides structure for managing dependencies and ensuring integration.*

### Question 5
**During a Sprint Retrospective, the team identifies an organizational impediment they cannot resolve themselves. What should the Scrum Master do?**
A) Tell the team to focus only on impediments they can control
B) Work to remove the impediment and keep the team informed of progress
C) Escalate the impediment to senior management immediately
D) Add the impediment to the Product Backlog

**Answer: B) Work to remove the impediment and keep the team informed of progress**
*Explanation: The Scrum Master is accountable for causing the removal of impediments. For organizational impediments, this means working outside the team while keeping them informed of progress.*

### Question 6
**A team member approaches you privately with concerns about another team member's behavior. How should you handle this?**
A) Address the issue with the problematic team member directly
B) Bring it up in the next Daily Scrum
C) Help the concerned team member find ways to address it themselves
D) Ignore it since it's a personal issue

**Answer: C) Help the concerned team member find ways to address it themselves**
*Explanation: As a coach, the Scrum Master should help individuals develop their own problem-solving capabilities. This empowers the team member and builds their skills for future situations.*

### Question 7
**Your organization is implementing Scrum but wants to keep their existing project management processes. What should you recommend?**
A) Adapt Scrum to fit the existing processes
B) Run both processes in parallel
C) Help the organization understand that Scrum requires empirical management
D) Focus only on the development teams and ignore organizational processes

**Answer: C) Help the organization understand that Scrum requires empirical management**
*Explanation: Scrum is based on empirical process control, which may conflict with traditional project management approaches. The Scrum Master should educate the organization about this fundamental difference.*

### Question 8
**A stakeholder complains that the development team is not delivering enough features. How should you respond?**
A) Tell the team to work faster
B) Help the stakeholder understand the importance of sustainable pace and quality
C) Suggest adding more team members
D) Recommend reducing the Definition of Done

**Answer: B) Help the stakeholder understand the importance of sustainable pace and quality**
*Explanation: The Scrum Master should educate stakeholders about Scrum principles, including the importance of maintaining a sustainable pace and focusing on value over volume.*

### Question 9
**Your team is consistently not meeting their Sprint commitments. What is the most likely cause?**
A) The team is not working hard enough
B) The estimates are too high
C) There are impediments affecting the team's ability to deliver
D) The Sprint Goal is not clear enough

**Answer: C) There are impediments affecting the team's ability to deliver**
*Explanation: Consistent failure to meet commitments usually indicates systemic impediments. The Scrum Master should investigate and help remove these impediments rather than assume the team isn't working hard enough.*

### Question 10
**How should a Scrum Master handle a situation where senior management is pressuring the team to commit to more work than they believe they can complete?**
A) Tell the team to commit to the additional work
B) Help protect the team from external pressure while educating management about the risks
