```

**Value Stream Analysis:**
- **Value-Added Time**: Time spent on activities that create customer value
- **Non-Value-Added Time**: Waste, delays, handoffs
- **Lead Time**: Total time from request to delivery
- **Process Time**: Time actively working on the item

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Team Coordination Issues

**Situation**: You're working with an organization that has 8 Scrum Teams working on the same product. Teams are experiencing significant integration issues, duplicated work, and conflicting priorities. The Product Owner is overwhelmed trying to coordinate with all teams.

**Key Challenges:**
- Lack of coordination between teams
- Integration problems
- Overwhelmed Product Owner
- Conflicting priorities

**Your Approach:**
1. **Assess Current State**: Map dependencies, identify coordination gaps
2. **Implement Nexus Framework**: Structure for multi-team coordination
3. **Establish Product Owner Support**: Area Product Owners or proxy roles
4. **Create Integration Practices**: Continuous integration, shared Definition of Done
5. **Facilitate Cross-Team Collaboration**: Communities of practice, cross-team events

### Scenario 2: Organizational Resistance to Change

**Situation**: Senior management has mandated an "Agile Transformation" but middle management is actively resisting. They continue to use traditional project management practices, create detailed upfront plans, and hold teams accountable to estimates. Team morale is low, and there's confusion about which practices to follow.

**Key Challenges:**
- Management resistance
- Conflicting practices
- Low team morale
- Confusion about expectations

**Your Approach:**
1. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify resistance sources and motivations
2. **Education Strategy**: Help managers understand agile benefits
3. **Pilot Approach**: Start with willing participants to demonstrate value
4. **Coaching Support**: Provide individual coaching to resistant managers
5. **Success Metrics**: Establish measures that matter to management

### Scenario 3: Technical Debt and Quality Issues

**Situation**: A Scrum Team is under pressure to deliver features quickly. Over time, they've accumulated significant technical debt, which is now slowing them down. Quality issues are increasing, and the team spends most of their time fixing bugs rather than delivering new value. Management is frustrated with the team's velocity decline.

**Key Challenges:**
- Technical debt accumulation
- Quality degradation
- Velocity decline
- Management pressure

**Your Approach:**
1. **Make Technical Debt Visible**: Create metrics and visualizations
2. **Educate Stakeholders**: Help them understand the cost of technical debt
3. **Definition of Done**: Strengthen quality standards
4. **Dedicated Time**: Allocate capacity for technical improvement
5. **Technical Practices**: Introduce or improve engineering practices
