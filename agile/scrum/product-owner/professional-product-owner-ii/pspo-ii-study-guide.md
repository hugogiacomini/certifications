## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Competing Stakeholder Demands

**Situation**: You're the Product Owner for a B2B software platform. The sales team wants new features to close a major deal, the support team needs bug fixes to reduce ticket volume, the marketing team wants analytics features for a campaign, and the engineering team wants to pay down technical debt. All requests seem urgent and important.

**Key Challenges:**
- Multiple urgent priorities from different stakeholders
- Limited development capacity
- Different success metrics for each stakeholder group
- Pressure to satisfy everyone

**Your Approach:**
1. **Establish Clear Value Criteria**: Define objective measures for evaluating requests
2. **Quantify Impact**: Work with stakeholders to estimate business impact of each request
3. **Assess Effort**: Collaborate with the development team to estimate implementation effort
4. **Create Value Matrix**: Plot requests on value vs. effort matrix
5. **Communicate Trade-offs**: Make the cost of choices visible to all stakeholders
6. **Implement Transparent Process**: Use consistent criteria for all future prioritization decisions

### Scenario 2: Product Market Fit Challenges

**Situation**: Your product launched six months ago with high expectations, but user adoption is slower than projected. Customer interviews reveal mixed feedback - some love certain features while others find the product confusing. The executive team is pressuring for rapid feature additions to attract more users, but data suggests current users aren't fully engaged.

**Key Challenges:**
- Unclear product-market fit
- Pressure for feature expansion vs. optimization
- Mixed user feedback requiring interpretation
- Executive pressure for growth

**Your Approach:**
1. **Deep Customer Analysis**: Segment users by engagement and satisfaction levels
2. **Identify Success Patterns**: Understand what makes successful users successful
3. **Focus on Core Value**: Identify and strengthen the primary value proposition
4. **Reduce Friction**: Address usability issues preventing user success
5. **Measure Leading Indicators**: Track engagement metrics that predict retention
6. **Educate Stakeholders**: Share insights about the importance of retention before growth

### Scenario 3: Technical Debt vs. New Features

**Situation**: Your development team reports that technical debt is significantly slowing down development velocity. They estimate that 40% of their time is spent working around existing code issues. Meanwhile, competitive pressure requires rapid feature delivery, and stakeholders are frustrated with the pace of visible progress.

**Key Challenges:**
- Invisible technical debt impacting delivery speed
- Stakeholder focus on visible features over infrastructure
- Developer frustration with code quality
- Competitive pressure for rapid delivery

**Your Approach:**
1. **Make Technical Debt Visible**: Create metrics showing the impact on delivery speed
2. **Calculate Cost of Delay**: Quantify how technical debt affects time to market
3. **Propose Balanced Approach**: Allocate percentage of capacity to technical improvements
4. **Show Progressive Improvement**: Demonstrate velocity improvements from debt reduction
5. **Link to Business Impact**: Connect technical improvements to business outcomes
6. **Set Quality Standards**: Establish Definition of Done that prevents future debt accumulation
