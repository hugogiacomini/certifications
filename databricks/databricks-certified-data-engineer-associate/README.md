df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["id", "name", "amount"])
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("practice.customers")

# Practice basic queries
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM practice.customers WHERE amount > 1000").show()
```

```python
# Set up Auto Loader for JSON files
df = spark.readStream \
    .format("cloudFiles") \
    .option("cloudFiles.format", "json") \
    .option("cloudFiles.schemaLocation", "/tmp/schema") \
    .load("/mnt/source-data/")

query = df.writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/tmp/checkpoint") \
    .table("bronze.raw_events")
```

### Lab 3: Delta Lake Operations
```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

# Practice MERGE operations
delta_table = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "practice.customers")
updates = spark.createDataFrame([(1, "Alice Smith", 1800.0), (4, "Diana", 1200.0)], 
                               ["id", "name", "amount"])

delta_table.alias("target").merge(
    updates.alias("source"), "target.id = source.id"
).whenMatchedUpdateAll().whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()
```

### Lab 4: Unity Catalog Setup
```sql
-- Practice catalog and schema creation
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS practice_catalog;
USE CATALOG practice_catalog;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS bronze COMMENT 'Raw data layer';
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS silver COMMENT 'Cleaned data layer';
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS gold COMMENT 'Business layer';

-- Practice permission management
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG practice_catalog TO `data-team@company.com`;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA practice_catalog.gold TO `business-users@company.com`;
```
