# Prompt Engineering and Design

## Overview

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting input text to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) toward producing desired outputs. In the context of Databricks Generative AI applications, effective prompt design is crucial for building robust, reliable, and high-performing AI systems.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Prompt Components

A well-structured prompt typically consists of:

```
[System Context] + [Task Description] + [Input Data] + [Output Format] + [Examples]
```

#### System Context
Establishes the role and behavior of the AI:
```python
system_prompt = """You are an expert data analyst specializing in customer behavior analysis. 
You provide accurate, actionable insights based on data patterns."""
```

#### Task Description
Clearly defines what the model should accomplish:
```python
task_prompt = """Analyze the following customer transaction data and identify key trends 
that indicate potential churn risk."""
```

#### Input Data
The actual data or context to be processed:
```python
input_data = """Customer ID: 12345
Recent transactions: [list of transactions]
Support tickets: [list of tickets]"""
```

#### Output Format
Specifies the structure of the expected response:
```python
format_prompt = """Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "churn_risk": "high|medium|low",
  "key_indicators": ["indicator1", "indicator2"],
  "recommendations": ["action1", "action2"]
}"""
```

### 2. Prompt Engineering Techniques

#### Few-Shot Learning
Providing examples to guide model behavior:

```python
few_shot_prompt = """
Examples:
Input: "Customer bought 5 items last month, no support tickets"
Output: {"churn_risk": "low", "key_indicators": ["regular_purchases"], "recommendations": ["maintain_engagement"]}

Input: "Customer bought 0 items last month, 3 support tickets about billing"
Output: {"churn_risk": "high", "key_indicators": ["no_purchases", "billing_issues"], "recommendations": ["immediate_intervention", "billing_review"]}

Now analyze:
Input: {customer_data}
Output:
"""
```

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encouraging step-by-step reasoning:

```python
cot_prompt = """
Let's analyze this customer step by step:

1. First, examine the purchase history
2. Then, review support interactions
3. Next, consider engagement metrics
4. Finally, assess overall churn risk

Customer data: {customer_data}

Step-by-step analysis:
"""
```

#### Zero-Shot Prompting
Direct task instruction without examples:

```python
zero_shot_prompt = """
Analyze the customer data below and determine churn risk. Consider purchase frequency, 
support interactions, and engagement patterns.

Customer data: {customer_data}
"""
```

## Databricks Implementation

### 1. Using Foundation Model APIs

```python
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
import mlflow

# Initialize Databricks client
w = WorkspaceClient()

def create_optimized_prompt(customer_data, prompt_template):
    """
    Create an optimized prompt for customer analysis
    """
    base_prompt = f"""
    You are a customer success AI assistant integrated with Databricks.
    
    Task: Analyze customer behavior and predict churn risk.
    
    Instructions:
    - Be precise and data-driven
    - Use the provided customer data only
    - Format output as valid JSON
    
    Customer Data:
    {customer_data}
    
    {prompt_template}
    """
    
    return base_prompt

# Example usage with Databricks Foundation Models
def analyze_customer_churn(customer_data):
    prompt = create_optimized_prompt(
        customer_data, 
        "Provide churn analysis with confidence scores."
    )
    
    # Call Foundation Model API
    response = w.serving_endpoints.query(
        name="databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct",
        inputs=[{"prompt": prompt}]
    )
    
    return response
```

### 2. Prompt Templates with MLflow

```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel

class CustomerAnalysisModel(PythonModel):
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompt_template = """
        Analyze customer {customer_id} with the following data:
        
        Transaction History: {transactions}
        Support Tickets: {support_tickets}
        Engagement Score: {engagement_score}
        
        Provide analysis in JSON format:
        {{
            "churn_probability": <0.0-1.0>,
            "risk_factors": [<list of factors>],
            "recommended_actions": [<list of actions>]
        }}
        """
    
    def predict(self, context, model_input):
        # Format prompt with input data
        formatted_prompt = self.prompt_template.format(**model_input)
        
        # Call LLM (using Foundation Model API)
        response = self._call_llm(formatted_prompt)
        
        return response
    
    def _call_llm(self, prompt):
        # Implementation for calling Databricks Foundation Models
        pass

# Register model with MLflow
with mlflow.start_run():
    model = CustomerAnalysisModel()
    mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(
        "customer_analysis_model",
        python_model=model,
        signature=mlflow.models.infer_signature(
            {"customer_id": "12345", "transactions": [], "support_tickets": [], "engagement_score": 0.8},
            {"churn_probability": 0.3, "risk_factors": [], "recommended_actions": []}
        )
    )
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Specificity and Clarity
- Be explicit about desired outputs
- Avoid ambiguous language
- Define technical terms when necessary

```python
# Good: Specific and clear
prompt = """
Extract sentiment from customer feedback. Classify as:
- POSITIVE: Customer expresses satisfaction
- NEGATIVE: Customer expresses dissatisfaction  
- NEUTRAL: No clear sentiment expressed

Return only the classification label.

Customer feedback: "{feedback_text}"
Classification:
"""

# Avoid: Vague and ambiguous
prompt = "What does the customer think about this?"
```

### 2. Context Length Management

```python
def optimize_prompt_length(context, max_tokens=4000):
    """
    Optimize prompt length for model constraints
    """
    # Estimate token count (rough approximation: 1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters)
    estimated_tokens = len(context) // 4
    
    if estimated_tokens > max_tokens:
        # Truncate or summarize context
        context = context[:max_tokens * 4]
        context += "\n[Content truncated for length optimization]"
    
    return context
```

### 3. Error Handling and Validation

```python
import json
import re

def validate_llm_response(response, expected_format="json"):
    """
    Validate and sanitize LLM responses
    """
    try:
        if expected_format == "json":
            # Attempt to parse JSON
            parsed = json.loads(response)
            return True, parsed
        elif expected_format == "structured":
            # Validate structured format
            required_fields = ["churn_risk", "confidence", "factors"]
            if all(field in response for field in required_fields):
                return True, response
        
        return False, None
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError) as e:
        return False, f"Validation error: {str(e)}"

def create_robust_prompt(task, data, fallback_format=True):
    """
    Create prompt with fallback formatting instructions
    """
    main_prompt = f"""
    Task: {task}
    Data: {data}
    
    Provide response in JSON format. If JSON is not possible, 
    use the following structure:
    
    RESULT: [your main answer]
    CONFIDENCE: [0.0-1.0]
    REASONING: [brief explanation]
    """
    
    if fallback_format:
        main_prompt += """
        
        IMPORTANT: If you cannot provide JSON, use the structured format above.
        Always include all three fields: RESULT, CONFIDENCE, and REASONING.
        """
    
    return main_prompt
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Prompt Adaptation

```python
class AdaptivePromptGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = {}
    
    def generate_prompt(self, task_type, data, user_feedback=None):
        """
        Generate prompts based on historical performance
        """
        base_template = self._get_base_template(task_type)
        
        # Adapt based on previous feedback
        if user_feedback:
            base_template = self._adapt_template(base_template, user_feedback)
        
        return base_template.format(data=data)
    
    def _get_base_template(self, task_type):
        templates = {
            "sentiment": """
            Analyze sentiment in: {data}
            Classification: POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL
            Confidence: 0.0-1.0
            """,
            "summarization": """
            Summarize the following content in 2-3 sentences: {data}
            Focus on key points and actionable insights.
            """,
            "extraction": """
            Extract structured information from: {data}
            Format as JSON with relevant fields.
            """
        }
        return templates.get(task_type, templates["extraction"])
    
    def _adapt_template(self, template, feedback):
        # Implement adaptation logic based on feedback
        if "too verbose" in feedback.lower():
            template += "\nBe concise and direct."
        elif "more detail" in feedback.lower():
            template += "\nProvide detailed explanation."
        
        return template
```

### 2. Prompt Versioning and A/B Testing

import mlflow
from typing import Dict, List

class PromptVersionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.versions = {}
        self.performance_metrics = {}
    
    def register_prompt_version(self, name: str, version: str, template: str):
        """Register a new prompt version for A/B testing"""
        key = f"{name}_v{version}"
        self.versions[key] = template
        
        # Log to MLflow for tracking
        with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"prompt_{key}"):
            mlflow.log_param("prompt_name", name)
            mlflow.log_param("prompt_version", version)
            mlflow.log_text(template, f"prompt_template_{key}.txt")
    
    def evaluate_prompt_performance(self, prompt_key: str, test_data: List[Dict]):
        """Evaluate prompt performance on test dataset"""
        results = []
        
        for data_point in test_data:
            prompt = self.versions[prompt_key].format(**data_point["input"])
            
            # Call LLM and measure performance
            response = self._call_llm(prompt)
            
            # Calculate metrics
            accuracy = self._calculate_accuracy(response, data_point["expected"])
            latency = self._measure_latency(prompt)
            
            results.append({
                "accuracy": accuracy,
                "latency": latency,
                "input_length": len(prompt)
            })
        
        # Log metrics to MLflow
        avg_accuracy = sum(r["accuracy"] for r in results) / len(results)
        avg_latency = sum(r["latency"] for r in results) / len(results)
        
        with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"evaluation_{prompt_key}"):
            mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", avg_accuracy)
            mlflow.log_metric("latency", avg_latency)
            mlflow.log_metric("test_samples", len(test_data))
        
        return results
```
