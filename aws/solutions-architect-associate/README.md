## Comprehensive Practice Test

### Multi-Domain Scenario Questions

#### Question 1: Secure, Resilient, High-Performance Architecture
A financial services company needs a web application that handles sensitive customer data. The application must be secure, highly available across multiple regions, and provide low latency to global users. What architecture best meets these requirements?

A) Single-region deployment with strong security controls
B) Multi-region active-passive with CloudFront, WAF, and encrypted storage
C) Multi-region active-active with comprehensive security and performance optimization
D) Serverless architecture with basic security controls

**Answer: C**
**Explanation**: Financial services require the highest levels of security, availability, and performance. An active-active multi-region deployment with comprehensive security (WAF, encryption, IAM), high availability (multi-AZ, auto scaling), and performance optimization (CloudFront, Global Accelerator) meets all requirements.

#### Question 2: Cost-Optimized Resilient Architecture
A startup needs a cost-effective architecture for their web application that can handle traffic spikes but minimize costs during low usage periods. The application can tolerate some interruptions. What strategy should they implement?

A) All Reserved Instances for predictable costs
B) Mix of On-Demand and Spot instances with Auto Scaling
C) Serverless architecture with on-demand scaling
D) Single large instance to handle all traffic

**Answer: C**
**Explanation**: For a startup with variable traffic patterns, serverless architecture (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB) provides automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and built-in availability without managing infrastructure.
