## Section 1: Designing data processing systems (~22% of the exam)

### 1.1 Designing for security and compliance

#### Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Organization Policies

**Concepts:**  
IAM is the foundation of security in Google Cloud. It defines who (users, groups, service accounts) can access which resources and what actions they can perform. Organization policies allow you to enforce governance rules across your cloud environment.

**Best Practices:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions necessary for users or services to perform their tasks.
- **Use Predefined Roles:** Prefer predefined roles over custom roles to reduce complexity and risk.
- **Group-Based Access:** Assign roles to groups rather than individuals for easier management.
- **Service Accounts:** Use service accounts for applications and automation, not for human users.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review IAM policies and audit logs to detect excessive permissions or anomalies.
- **Organization Policies:** Use these to enforce constraints, such as restricting resource creation to specific regions or disabling external IPs.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Assign IAM roles at the organization, folder, project, or resource level.
- Use Cloud IAM Conditions for context-aware access (e.g., time-based, IP-based).
- Audit permissions using Cloud Asset Inventory and Policy Analyzer.
- Use Cloud Identity for managing users and groups.

**Example:**
```bash
# Grant BigQuery Data Viewer role to a group at the project level
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project \
    --member="group:data-analysts@example.com" \
    --role="roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
```

#### Data Security: Encryption and Key Management

**Concepts:**  
Data security in GCP is achieved through encryption at rest and in transit, and robust key management. Encryption ensures data confidentiality, while key management controls access to encrypted data.

**Best Practices:**
- **Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit:** All sensitive data should be encrypted.
- **Centralized Key Management:** Use Cloud KMS for managing cryptographic keys.
- **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate encryption keys to reduce risk.
- **CMEK/CSEK:** Use Customer-Managed or Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys for strict compliance.
- **Restrict Key Access:** Use IAM to tightly control who can use or manage keys.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Data is encrypted by default at rest and in transit.
- Use Cloud KMS to create, manage, and rotate keys.
- Enable CMEK for services like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Compute Engine disks.
- Use audit logs to monitor key usage.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a new key ring and key in Cloud KMS
gcloud kms keyrings create my-keyring --location=us-central1
gcloud kms keys create my-key --location=us-central1 --keyring=my-keyring --purpose=encryption
```
- Enable CMEK for a BigQuery dataset via the console or API.

#### Privacy: PII, PHI, PCI, and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API

**Concepts:**  
Privacy protection involves identifying, classifying, and securing sensitive data such as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), PHI (Protected Health Information), or PCI (Payment Card Information). Data minimization, masking, and tokenization are key techniques.

**Best Practices:**
- **Data Discovery:** Use Cloud DLP to scan and classify sensitive data.
- **Data Masking/Tokenization:** Mask or tokenize sensitive fields before storage or sharing.
- **Access Controls:** Limit access to sensitive data using IAM and VPC Service Controls.
- **Retention Policies:** Implement data retention and deletion policies to comply with regulations.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Use Cloud DLP API to inspect, classify, and redact sensitive data in BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or Datastore.
- Set up scheduled DLP jobs for continuous monitoring.
- Apply transformation templates for masking or tokenization.

**Example:**
```bash
# Inspect a Cloud Storage file for PII using DLP
gcloud dlp jobs create inspect-gcs \
    --project=my-project \
    --storage-config-file=storage-config.json \
    --inspect-config-file=inspect-config.json
```
- Use DLP to mask or tokenize sensitive columns in BigQuery.

#### Regional Considerations: Data Sovereignty

**Concepts:**  
Data sovereignty refers to the legal and regulatory requirements that dictate where data must be stored and processed. Organizations may need to keep data within specific geographic boundaries.

**Best Practices:**
- **Region Selection:** Choose storage locations that comply with data residency requirements.
- **Organization Policies:** Use policies to restrict resource creation to approved regions.
- **Understand Storage Classes:** Know the difference between multi-region and single-region storage.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Specify region or multi-region when creating storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, etc.
- Use Organization Policy Service to enforce location constraints.
- Monitor resource locations using Cloud Asset Inventory.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a Cloud Storage bucket in the EU region
gsutil mb -l EU gs://my-eu-bucket/
```
- Enforce resource location policy using Organization Policy Service.

#### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

**Concepts:**  
Compliance ensures adherence to laws and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and others. This includes data handling, storage, processing, and access controls.

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Compliance Resources:** Leverage Google Cloud’s compliance certifications and documentation.
- **Enable Audit Logs:** Monitor all critical resources.

- **Continuous Review:** Regularly review compliance documentation and update controls as regulations evolve.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Enable Cloud Audit Logs for all services.
- Use Access Transparency to monitor Google support access.
- Use Access Approval to require explicit approval for Google support actions.
- Review compliance reports in the Google Cloud Console.

**Example:**
```bash
# Enable audit logs for all admin activity in a project
gcloud logging sinks create my-sink storage.googleapis.com/my-audit-logs-bucket \
    --log-filter='logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com"'
```
- Review compliance documentation at https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance

**Streaming Transformations:**
- **Concepts:** Process data in real time as it arrives, often with low latency requirements.
- **Windowing:** Group events into time-based or count-based windows for aggregation.
- **Late Arriving Data:** Handle out-of-order or delayed events using watermarking and triggers.
- **Best Practices:** Design for idempotency, monitor lag, and handle late data gracefully.
- **GCP Implementation:** Use Dataflow (streaming mode) with windowing and triggers, Pub/Sub for ingestion, and BigQuery streaming inserts.

**Language:**
- **Apache Beam:** Supports Java, Python, and Go for pipeline development.
- **Spark:** Use Scala, Python (PySpark), or Java on Dataproc.
- **SQL:** Use BigQuery for SQL-based transformations.

**Example:**
```python
# Dataflow streaming pipeline with windowing
(p
 | 'ReadFromPubSub' >> beam.io.ReadFromPubSub(subscription='projects/myproject/subscriptions/mysub')
 | 'Window' >> beam.WindowInto(beam.window.FixedWindows(60))  # 1-minute windows
 | 'Transform' >> beam.Map(transform_fn)
 | 'WriteToBQ' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery('myproject:dataset.table'))
```
- Use triggers and allowed lateness to handle late data in Beam.

---

#### Ad Hoc Data Ingestion

**Concepts:**  
Ad hoc ingestion refers to one-time or infrequent data loads, as opposed to automated, recurring pipelines.

**Best Practices:**
- **Automate When Possible:** Even for one-time loads, use scripts or templates for repeatability.
- **Validate Data:** Run validation checks before and after ingestion.
- **Document Process:** Record steps for auditability and future reference.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **BigQuery:** Use `bq load` for manual or scripted data loads.
- **Cloud Storage:** Upload files via console, gsutil, or API.
- **Dataflow Templates:** Use for parameterized, reusable ingestion jobs.

**Example:**
```bash
# Load CSV data into BigQuery
bq load --source_format=CSV mydataset.mytable gs://my-bucket/data.csv schema.json
```
- Use Dataflow Flex Templates for parameterized ad hoc jobs.

---

#### Data Acquisition and Import

**Concepts:**  
Data acquisition is the process of collecting data from various sources and importing it into your cloud environment.

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Connectors:** Leverage built-in connectors for SaaS, databases, and APIs.

    - Integrate with GCP services (Dataflow, BigQuery, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions).
    - Schedule jobs, manage dependencies, and monitor execution via Airflow UI.
    - Example:
        ```python
        from airflow import DAG
        from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataflow import DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator
        from datetime import datetime

        with DAG('etl_pipeline', schedule_interval='@daily', start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1)) as dag:
                start_dataflow = DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator(
                        task_id='run_dataflow',
                        template='gs://my-templates/my-template',
                        parameters={'input': 'gs://my-bucket/input.csv', 'output': 'gs://my-bucket/output.csv'},
                        location='us-central1'
                )
        ```
- **Workflows:**
    - Serverless orchestration for integrating GCP services and APIs.
    - Define workflows in YAML or JSON, supporting conditional logic, parallel execution, and error handling.

        main:
            steps:
            - init:
                    assign:
                    - project: ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
            - startDataflow:
                    call: googleapis.dataflow.projects.locations.templates.launch
                    args:
                        projectId: ${project}
                        location: "us-central1"
                        gcsPath: "gs://my-templates/my-template"
                        body:
                            parameters:
                                input: "gs://my-bucket/input.csv"
                                output: "gs://my-bucket/output.csv"
                    result: dataflowResult
            - theEnd:
                    return: ${dataflowResult}
        ```
- **Cloud Scheduler:**
    - Cron-like service to trigger workflows, Cloud Functions, or Pub/Sub messages on a schedule.
    - Use for simple periodic triggers.

- **Pub/Sub Triggers:**
    - Event-driven orchestration by publishing messages to topics that trigger downstream processing.

## Section 3: Storing the Data (~20% of the exam)

### 3.1 Selecting Storage Systems

Choosing the right storage system in Google Cloud is critical for balancing performance, cost, scalability, and operational simplicity. This section explores the key considerations, best practices, and GCP implementations for effective data storage design.

---

#### Analyzing Data Access Patterns

**Concepts:**
- **Access Patterns:** Understanding how data will be read, written, updated, and deleted is foundational. Patterns include transactional (frequent reads/writes), analytical (large scans, aggregations), streaming, random vs. sequential access, and latency requirements.
- **Workload Types:** OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) vs. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), hot vs. cold data, structured vs. unstructured data.

**Best Practices:**
- **Profile Workloads:** Analyze expected query types, frequency, concurrency, and data volume.
- **Separate Hot and Cold Data:** Store frequently accessed (hot) data in high-performance systems, and infrequently accessed (cold) data in cost-effective storage.
- **Consider Consistency Needs:** Choose storage with the appropriate consistency model (strong, eventual, transactional).
- **Plan for Growth:** Anticipate future data volume and access pattern changes.

**GCP Application:**
- Use **Cloud Monitoring** and **Query Insights** (BigQuery) to analyze access patterns.
- For transactional workloads (e.g., user profiles, orders), consider **Cloud SQL**, **Spanner**, or **Firestore**.
- For analytical workloads (e.g., reporting, ML), use **BigQuery** or **Cloud Storage**.
- For high-throughput, low-latency access (e.g., IoT, time series), use **Bigtable** or **Memorystore**.

---

#### Choosing Managed Services

**Concepts:**
- **Managed Services:** GCP offers a range of fully managed storage solutions, each optimized for specific use cases, data models, and access patterns.

**Key Services and Use Cases:**

| Service         | Data Model      | Use Cases                                   | Strengths                                 |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|

- Monitor **Cloud SQL** and **Spanner** performance metrics and adjust machine types or instance counts as needed.
- Use **Bigtable** autoscaling and monitor node utilization.

---

#### Lifecycle Management of Data

**Concepts:**
- **Data Lifecycle:** The stages data passes through: ingestion, storage, processing, archival, and deletion.
- **Retention Policies:** Define how long data is kept to meet compliance and business needs.
- **Automated Transitions:** Move data between storage classes or delete it based on age or access patterns.

**Best Practices:**
- **Define Retention Policies:** Set clear rules for how long data is retained and when it should be deleted or archived.
- **Automate Lifecycle Transitions:** Use built-in tools to move or delete data automatically.
- **Comply with Regulations:** Ensure lifecycle policies meet GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific requirements.
- **Document Policies:** Maintain clear documentation for audits and operational clarity.

**GCP Application:**
- **Cloud Storage:** Use Object Lifecycle Management to automate transitions (e.g., move to Coldline after 30 days, delete after 365 days).
    ```json
    {
      "rule": [
        {
          "action": {"type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "COLDLINE"},
          "condition": {"age": 30}
        },
        {
          "action": {"type": "Delete"},
          "condition": {"age": 365}
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    Apply with:
    ```bash
    gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://my-bucket
    ```
- **BigQuery:** Set table expiration at dataset or table level to automatically delete old data.
    ```bash
    bq update --table --expiration 2592000 mydataset.mytable  # 30 days in seconds
    ```
- **Cloud SQL/Spanner:** Use automated backups and point-in-time recovery; set backup retention periods.
- **Firestore/Bigtable:** Implement TTL (Time to Live) policies at the application level or via scheduled jobs.

### 3.2 Planning for Using a Data Warehouse

A data warehouse is a central repository for integrated, subject-oriented, and time-variant data, optimized for analytics and reporting. In Google Cloud, BigQuery is the primary managed data warehouse solution, offering scalability, performance, and serverless operation. Effective planning for a data warehouse involves careful consideration of data modeling, normalization, business requirements, and architectural design to support diverse access patterns.

---

#### Designing the Data Model

**Concepts:**
- The data model defines how data is structured, stored, and related within the warehouse.
- Common models include star schema, snowflake schema, and flat tables.
- The model should balance query performance, maintainability, and scalability.

**Best Practices:**
- **Star Schema:** Use for simplicity and fast query performance. Central fact tables reference dimension tables.
- **Snowflake Schema:** Normalize dimension tables for storage efficiency and data integrity, but may increase query complexity.
- **Flat Tables:** Denormalize for very high-performance analytics, at the cost of storage and potential data duplication.
- **Clearly Define Facts and Dimensions:** Facts are measurable events (e.g., sales), dimensions provide context (e.g., date, product).
- **Use Surrogate Keys:** Avoid natural keys for join consistency and performance.
- **Document the Model:** Maintain ER diagrams and data dictionaries for clarity and onboarding.

**GCP Application:**
- In **BigQuery**, create datasets for logical grouping, and tables for facts and dimensions.
- Use partitioned and clustered tables to optimize query performance and cost.
- Example star schema in BigQuery:
    ```sql
    -- Fact table: sales
    CREATE TABLE dataset.sales (
      sale_id INT64,
      date_id INT64,
      product_id INT64,
      store_id INT64,
      amount NUMERIC
    )
    PARTITION BY DATE(_PARTITIONTIME);

    -- Dimension table: product
    CREATE TABLE dataset.product (
      product_id INT64,
      name STRING,
      category STRING
    );
    ```
- Use **BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA** to document and audit schema changes.

---

#### Deciding the Degree of Data Normalization

**Concepts:**
- **Normalization** reduces data redundancy and improves integrity by organizing data into related tables.
- **Denormalization** combines tables to reduce joins and improve query speed, at the cost of storage and potential data anomalies.

**Best Practices:**
- **Balance Performance and Integrity:** Normalize dimensions for consistency; denormalize facts for performance.
- **Query Patterns Drive Design:** If most queries require joining many tables, consider denormalization.
- **Storage Is Cheap, Performance Is Priceless:** In cloud warehouses like BigQuery, storage costs are low compared to query costs.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Normalize where data changes frequently, denormalize for static or reference data.

**GCP Application:**
- Use **nested and repeated fields** in BigQuery to represent hierarchical or multi-valued data efficiently (semi-structured denormalization).
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE dataset.orders (
      order_id INT64,
      customer_id INT64,
      items ARRAY<STRUCT<product_id INT64, quantity INT64, price NUMERIC>>
    );
    ```
- Use **views** to present normalized or denormalized perspectives as needed.
- Regularly review query performance with **Query Plan Explanation** and **Query Insights**.

---

#### Mapping Business Requirements

**Concepts:**
- The warehouse must align with business goals, KPIs, and reporting needs.
- Requirements gathering ensures the model supports all necessary analytics and compliance needs.

**Best Practices:**
- **Engage Stakeholders Early:** Involve business users, analysts, and data engineers in requirements workshops.
- **Define Use Cases and KPIs:** Document all reporting, dashboard, and analytics needs.
- **Data Lineage and Traceability:** Ensure the model supports tracking data from source to report for audit and compliance.
- **Iterative Design:** Start with core requirements, expand as needs evolve.

**GCP Application:**
- Use **BigQuery Data Catalog** to tag tables and columns with business metadata, ownership, and sensitivity.
- Implement **access controls** (IAM) to restrict sensitive data to authorized users.
- Use **labels** and **descriptions** on datasets and tables for discoverability.
- Build **dashboards** in Looker Studio or Looker, connecting directly to BigQuery.

---

#### Defining Architecture to Support Data Access Patterns

**Concepts:**
- The architecture must support diverse access patterns: ad hoc queries, scheduled reports, machine learning, and data sharing.
- Consider concurrency, latency, and scalability.

**Best Practices:**
- **Partitioning:** Use date or integer partitioning to limit data scanned per query.
- **Clustering:** Cluster tables on frequently filtered columns (e.g., user_id, region) to improve performance.
- **Materialized Views:** Precompute and store common aggregations for fast access.
- **Data Security:** Implement row-level and column-level security for sensitive data.
- **Multi-Environment Architecture:** Separate dev, test, and prod datasets for governance and stability.
- **Data Sharing:** Use authorized views or BigQuery data sharing for cross-team or external access.

**GCP Application:**
- **Partitioned Tables:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE dataset.events (
      event_id INT64,
      event_date DATE,
      ...
    )
    PARTITION BY event_date;
    ```
- **Clustered Tables:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE dataset.sales
    CLUSTER BY product_id, store_id AS
    SELECT * FROM source_table;
    ```
- **Materialized Views:**
    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dataset.daily_sales AS
    SELECT event_date, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM dataset.sales
    GROUP BY event_date;
    ```
- **Row/Column Security:**
    - Use **BigQuery row-level access policies** and **column-level security** to restrict data.
- **Monitoring and Optimization:**
    - Use **BigQuery Monitoring** and **Query Insights** to track usage and optimize resources.
- **Integration:**
    - Connect BigQuery to **Looker**, **Data Studio**, or **AI Platform** for analytics and ML.

## Section 4: Preparing and Using Data for Analysis (~15% of the exam)

### 4.1 Preparing Data for Visualization

Preparing data for visualization is a critical step in the analytics lifecycle. It ensures that data is accessible, performant, secure, and structured in a way that supports effective insights. Below are the key considerations and best practices for preparing data for visualization in Google Cloud.

---

#### Connecting to Visualization Tools

**Concepts:**
- Visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI) require secure, performant connections to data sources.
- Direct connections to BigQuery or via connectors/APIs are common in GCP.

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Native Connectors:** Prefer native BigQuery connectors in visualization tools for optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Service Accounts:** Use dedicated service accounts with least-privilege IAM roles for tool authentication.
- **Connection Pooling:** For high concurrency, use tools that support connection pooling to avoid exceeding quotas.
- **Network Security:** Use Private Google Access or VPC Service Controls to restrict access to BigQuery and Cloud Storage.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Enable the BigQuery API and create a service account with `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` or more restrictive custom roles.
- Download and securely store the service account key for use in the visualization tool.
- In Looker Studio, use the BigQuery connector and select the appropriate project, dataset, and table.
- For Tableau/Power BI, install the BigQuery ODBC/JDBC driver and configure the connection using service account credentials.

---

#### Precalculating Fields

**Concepts:**
- Precalculated fields are derived columns or aggregations computed before visualization, reducing query complexity and improving dashboard performance.
- Examples: totals, averages, ratios, flags, or business-specific metrics.

**Best Practices:**
- **Materialize Expensive Calculations:** Precompute metrics that are costly to calculate on the fly.
- **Store in Tables or Views:** Use BigQuery scheduled queries to write results to new tables or views.
- **Document Logic:** Clearly document how fields are calculated for transparency and reproducibility.
- **Update Frequency:** Schedule recalculations based on business needs (e.g., hourly, daily).

**GCP Implementation:**
- Use BigQuery scheduled queries to create and refresh tables with precalculated fields.
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dataset.daily_sales_summary AS
    SELECT
      DATE(order_timestamp) AS order_date,
      COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
      SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
      AVG(amount) AS avg_order_value
    FROM dataset.orders
    GROUP BY order_date;
    ```
- Use Dataflow or Data Fusion for more complex ETL logic before loading into BigQuery.

---

#### BigQuery Materialized Views (View Logic)

**Concepts:**
- Materialized views in BigQuery store precomputed query results, automatically refreshed as underlying data changes.
- They improve performance and reduce costs for repetitive, complex aggregations.

**Best Practices:**
- **Use for Heavy Aggregations:** Materialize queries that are slow or expensive to compute on demand.
- **Partition and Cluster:** Partition and cluster materialized views for further performance gains.
- **Monitor Staleness:** Understand refresh intervals and ensure data freshness meets business requirements.
- **Limit Complexity:** Materialized views support a subset of SQL; avoid unsupported features.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Create a materialized view for common dashboard queries:
    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dataset.mv_daily_sales AS
    SELECT
      DATE(order_timestamp) AS order_date,
      product_id,
      SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM dataset.orders
    GROUP BY order_date, product_id;
    ```
- Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA to monitor materialized view refresh status and staleness.
- Reference materialized views in BI tools for fast, cost-effective queries.

---

#### Determining Granularity of Time Data

**Concepts:**
- Granularity refers to the level of detail for time-based data (e.g., year, month, day, hour, minute).
- The right granularity balances performance, storage, and analytical needs.

**Best Practices:**
- **Align with Business Questions:** Choose granularity that matches reporting requirements (e.g., daily sales, hourly traffic).
- **Partition Tables by Time:** In BigQuery, partition tables by DATE or TIMESTAMP columns for efficient querying.
- **Aggregate Early:** Pre-aggregate data to the lowest required granularity to reduce query costs.
- **Flexible Design:** Store raw data at fine granularity, but provide aggregated tables/views for common use cases.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Partition BigQuery tables by date:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE dataset.events (
      event_id STRING,
      event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
      ...
    )
    PARTITION BY DATE(event_timestamp);
    ```
- Use scheduled queries to create summary tables at required granularity:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dataset.hourly_events AS
    SELECT
      TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(event_timestamp, HOUR) AS event_hour,
      COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM dataset.events
    GROUP BY event_hour;
    ```

---

#### Troubleshooting Poor Performing Queries

**Concepts:**
- Poor query performance can result from inefficient SQL, large data scans, lack of partitioning/clustering, or resource contention.

**Best Practices:**
- **Use EXPLAIN and Query Plan:** Analyze query execution plans to identify bottlenecks.
- **Avoid SELECT *:** Only select needed columns to minimize data scanned.
- **Partition and Cluster:** Use partitioned and clustered tables to reduce scan costs and improve speed.
- **Filter Early:** Apply WHERE clauses on partition/clustering columns.
- **Optimize Joins:** Use appropriate join types and order, and avoid cross joins.
- **Monitor with Query Insights:** Use BigQuery Query Insights to identify slow or costly queries.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Use the BigQuery UI to view query execution details and stages.
- Refactor queries to use partition filters:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM dataset.events
    WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-07'
    ```
- Use Query Plan Explanation to identify full table scans or inefficient joins.
- Set up alerts for high-cost or long-running queries using Cloud Monitoring.

---

#### Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (Cloud DLP)

**Concepts:**
- **IAM:** Controls who can view, query, or modify data in BigQuery and other GCP services.
- **Cloud DLP:** Identifies, classifies, and protects sensitive data (e.g., PII, PHI) in datasets.

**Best Practices:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the permissions they need (e.g., `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` for read-only access).
- **Row/Column-Level Security:** Use BigQuery’s row-level and column-level access policies to restrict sensitive data.
- **Audit Access:** Enable Cloud Audit Logs to track data access and changes.
- **DLP Scanning:** Regularly scan datasets with Cloud DLP to detect and mask sensitive information.
- **Tokenization/Masking:** Use DLP to mask or tokenize sensitive fields before visualization.

**GCP Implementation:**
- Assign IAM roles at the project, dataset, or table level.
    ```bash
    bq update --set_iam_policy=policy.json myproject:dataset
    ```
- Define row-level access policies:
    ```sql
    CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY region_policy
    ON dataset.sales
    GRANT TO ('user:analyst@example.com')
    FILTER USING (region = 'US');
    ```
- Use Cloud DLP to inspect and mask sensitive data:
    ```bash
    gcloud dlp jobs create inspect-bq \
      --project=my-project \
      --inspect-config-file=inspect-config.json \
      --storage-config-file=storage-config.json
    ```
- Integrate DLP with Dataflow or scheduled jobs for continuous monitoring.

## Section 5: Maintaining and Automating Data Workloads (~18% of the exam)

### 5.1 Optimizing Resources

Optimizing resources in Google Cloud data workloads is essential for balancing cost, performance, and reliability. This involves careful planning, monitoring, and automation to ensure that data pipelines and storage systems meet business requirements without unnecessary overspending or resource contention.

---

#### Minimizing Costs per Required Business Need for Data

**Concepts:**
- Cost optimization is about aligning resource usage and spending with business priorities, ensuring you pay only for what you need while maintaining required service levels.
- In GCP, costs are driven by compute (VMs, Dataflow, Dataproc), storage (Cloud Storage, BigQuery), network egress, and managed service features.

**Best Practices:**
- **Right-Size Resources:** Select machine types, node counts, and service tiers that match workload requirements. Avoid over-provisioning.
- **Use Autoscaling:** Enable autoscaling for services like Dataproc, Dataflow, and BigQuery slots to automatically adjust resources based on demand.
- **Spot/Preemptible Instances:** Use preemptible VMs for non-critical or fault-tolerant batch jobs to reduce compute costs.
- **Optimize Storage Classes:** Store data in the most cost-effective storage class (e.g., Nearline, Coldline, Archive) based on access frequency.
- **Partition and Cluster Data:** In BigQuery, partition and cluster tables to minimize data scanned and reduce query costs.
- **Monitor and Set Budgets:** Use Cloud Billing, Budgets, and Cost Alerts to track spending and prevent overruns.
- **Schedule Jobs Off-Peak:** Run non-urgent batch jobs during off-peak hours when possible to take advantage of lower pricing or resource availability.
- **Data Lifecycle Management:** Automatically delete or archive obsolete data to avoid unnecessary storage costs.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **BigQuery:** Use table partitioning, clustering, and query cost estimates. Set table expiration to automatically delete old data.
- **Dataflow:** Use autoscaling and streaming engine for efficient resource usage. Monitor job metrics and optimize pipeline logic.
- **Dataproc:** Use autoscaling clusters, preemptible workers, and ephemeral (job-based) clusters for batch workloads.
- **Cloud Storage:** Apply lifecycle rules to transition or delete objects based on age or access patterns.
- **Cloud Billing:** Set up budgets, alerts, and use Cost Table Reports for detailed analysis.

---

#### Ensuring Enough Resources for Business-Critical Data Processes

**Concepts:**
- Business-critical workloads require guaranteed performance, availability, and reliability. Under-provisioning can lead to missed SLAs, data loss, or business disruption.
- Resource planning must account for peak loads, failover, and redundancy.

**Best Practices:**
- **Capacity Planning:** Analyze historical usage and forecast future demand to provision sufficient resources.
- **Dedicated Resources:** Use dedicated or reserved resources (e.g., BigQuery reserved slots, dedicated Dataproc clusters) for critical workloads.
- **High Availability:** Deploy resources across multiple zones or regions for redundancy (e.g., multi-region Cloud Storage, regional Dataproc clusters).
- **Resource Quotas:** Monitor and request quota increases proactively to avoid job failures due to quota exhaustion.
- **Priority Scheduling:** Use job priorities or separate environments to ensure critical jobs are not starved by lower-priority workloads.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up Cloud Monitoring and custom alerts for resource utilization, job failures, and performance bottlenecks.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Implement backup, snapshot, and failover strategies for critical data and pipelines.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **BigQuery:** Purchase reserved slots for predictable performance. Use workload management to prioritize queries.
- **Dataflow:** Monitor job health and autoscaling. Use streaming engine for high-throughput streaming jobs.
- **Dataproc:** Use regional clusters with autoscaling and preemptible workers for elasticity. For critical jobs, use persistent clusters with high-availability masters.
- **Cloud Monitoring:** Set up dashboards and alerts for CPU, memory, storage, and job status.
- **Cloud SQL/Spanner:** Enable automated backups, point-in-time recovery, and multi-zone replication.

---

#### Deciding Between Persistent or Job-Based Data Clusters (e.g., Dataproc)

**Concepts:**
- **Persistent Clusters:** Long-running clusters that are always available, suitable for frequent, interactive, or stateful workloads.
- **Job-Based (Ephemeral) Clusters:** Clusters created for the duration of a job and deleted afterward, ideal for batch or scheduled workloads.

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Persistent Clusters When:**
    - You have frequent, ad hoc, or interactive jobs.
    - You need fast job startup times.
    - You require shared state or cached data across jobs.
    - You need to support multiple users or teams concurrently.
- **Use Job-Based Clusters When:**
    - Workloads are batch-oriented, infrequent, or scheduled.
    - You want to minimize costs by only paying for resources during job execution.
    - You need strong isolation between jobs.
    - You want to avoid cluster drift or configuration issues over time.
- **Cluster Autoscaling:** Enable autoscaling to dynamically adjust the number of workers based on job demand, regardless of cluster type.
- **Preemptible Workers:** Use preemptible VMs for cost savings in non-critical or fault-tolerant jobs.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **Dataproc Persistent Cluster:**
        ```bash
        gcloud dataproc clusters create my-persistent-cluster \
            --region=us-central1 \
            --num-workers=4 \
            --enable-component-gateway \
            --autoscaling-policy=my-policy
        ```
- **Dataproc Job-Based (Ephemeral) Cluster:**
        ```bash
        gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark my_job.py \
            --region=us-central1 \
            --cluster=my-ephemeral-cluster \
            --create-cluster \
            --delete-cluster
        ```
        Or use workflow templates to automate ephemeral cluster creation and teardown.
- **Autoscaling Policy:**
        ```bash
        gcloud dataproc autoscaling-policies create my-policy \
            --region=us-central1 \
            --file=autoscaling-policy.yaml
        ```
- **Monitoring:** Use Dataproc and Cloud Monitoring dashboards to track cluster health, utilization, and costs.

### 5.2 Designing Automation and Repeatability

Automation and repeatability are foundational for reliable, scalable, and maintainable data workflows in Google Cloud. By automating orchestration and scheduling, you reduce manual intervention, minimize errors, and ensure consistent execution of data pipelines.

#### Creating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for Cloud Composer

**Concepts:**
- A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a collection of tasks with defined dependencies and execution order, ensuring no cycles exist.
- In Cloud Composer (managed Apache Airflow), DAGs orchestrate complex workflows across GCP services (Dataflow, BigQuery, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, etc.).

**Best Practices:**
- **Modularize Tasks:** Break workflows into reusable, independent tasks for maintainability.
- **Explicit Dependencies:** Clearly define task dependencies to avoid race conditions and ensure correct execution order.
- **Parameterization:** Use variables and configuration files to make DAGs reusable across environments (dev, test, prod).
- **Error Handling and Retries:** Implement retries, timeouts, and alerting for robust error management.
- **Idempotency:** Design tasks to be safely re-executed without side effects.
- **Version Control:** Store DAG code in source control (e.g., Git) for traceability and collaboration.
- **Documentation:** Use Airflow’s doc_md and comments to document DAG logic and business context.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **Author DAGs in Python:** Define tasks using Airflow operators (e.g., `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator`, `BigQueryInsertJobOperator`).
- **Leverage GCP Operators:** Use built-in operators for seamless integration with GCP services.
- **Schedule DAGs:** Set `schedule_interval` for periodic execution (cron syntax or presets like `@daily`).
- **Monitor DAGs:** Use Airflow UI for monitoring, logs, and manual triggering.
- **Environment Management:** Deploy DAGs to Cloud Composer environments via Cloud Storage or CI/CD pipelines.

**Example:**
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataflow import DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryInsertJobOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    'etl_workflow',
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    doc_md="""
    ### ETL Workflow
    This DAG orchestrates daily ETL using Dataflow and loads results into BigQuery.
    """
) as dag:
    run_dataflow = DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator(
        task_id='run_dataflow',
        template='gs://my-templates/etl-template',
        parameters={'input': 'gs://my-bucket/input.csv', 'output': 'gs://my-bucket/output.csv'},
        location='us-central1'
    )

    load_to_bq = BigQueryInsertJobOperator(
        task_id='load_to_bq',
        configuration={
            "load": {
                "sourceUris": ["gs://my-bucket/output.csv"],
                "destinationTable": {"projectId": "myproject", "datasetId": "analytics", "tableId": "daily_results"},
                "sourceFormat": "CSV",
                "writeDisposition": "WRITE_TRUNCATE"
            }
        }
    )

    run_dataflow >> load_to_bq
```
- **Testing:** Use Airflow’s test mode or local Airflow for development before deploying to Composer.
- **Dynamic DAGs:** Generate DAGs programmatically for similar workflows (e.g., per region or business unit).

#### Scheduling Jobs in a Repeatable Way

**Concepts:**
- Repeatable scheduling ensures jobs run at consistent intervals or in response to events, supporting SLAs and business processes.
- Scheduling can be time-based (cron), event-driven (Pub/Sub), or dependency-based (DAGs).

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Centralized Scheduling:** Prefer Cloud Composer or Cloud Scheduler for managing schedules, rather than ad hoc scripts.
- **Cron Syntax:** Use standard cron expressions for flexible time-based scheduling.
- **Event-Driven Triggers:** Use Pub/Sub or Workflows for event-based orchestration.
- **Idempotent Jobs:** Ensure jobs can be safely retried or rerun.
- **Alerting:** Set up notifications for job failures or missed schedules.
- **Auditability:** Log all job executions and outcomes for compliance and troubleshooting.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **Cloud Composer:** Schedule DAGs with `schedule_interval`.
- **Cloud Scheduler:** Trigger HTTP endpoints, Pub/Sub topics, or Cloud Functions on a schedule.
    ```bash
    gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub my-job \
      --schedule="0 2 * * *" \
      --topic=my-topic \
      --message-body="{'run': 'daily_etl'}"
    ```
- **Workflows:** Use for orchestrating multi-step, event-driven processes.
- **Monitoring:** Use Cloud Monitoring and Logging for job status and alerting.

### 5.3 Organizing Workloads Based on Business Requirements

Organizing data workloads to align with business needs ensures optimal performance, cost efficiency, and user experience. In BigQuery, this involves selecting the right slot pricing model and job type for each workload.

#### Flex, On-Demand, and Flat Rate Slot Pricing

**Concepts:**
- **On-Demand Pricing:** Pay per query, based on data scanned. No upfront commitment; ideal for unpredictable or low-volume workloads.
- **Flat Rate Pricing:** Purchase dedicated slots (compute capacity) for a fixed monthly fee. Predictable costs and reserved resources; best for high-volume or mission-critical workloads.
- **Flex Slots:** Short-term (minimum 60 seconds) slot commitments for bursty or temporary needs. Useful for handling spikes or testing flat rate benefits.

**Best Practices:**
- **Workload Assessment:** Analyze query volume, concurrency, and performance requirements.
- **Cost Modeling:** Estimate costs for on-demand vs. flat rate based on historical usage.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Use on-demand for ad hoc or unpredictable workloads; flat rate for steady, high-throughput jobs.
- **Slot Management:** Allocate slots to projects or reservations based on business priorities.
- **Monitor Utilization:** Use BigQuery Admin Panel and Monitoring to track slot usage and adjust reservations.
- **Flex Slots for Bursts:** Use flex slots to temporarily boost capacity during peak periods or migrations.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **On-Demand:** Default mode; no setup required.
- **Flat Rate:** Purchase slots via BigQuery Admin Panel or CLI.
    ```bash
    bq update --reservation --slots=1000 --project_id=myproject my_reservation
    ```
- **Assign Reservations:** Map projects or workloads to specific reservations for resource isolation.
    ```bash
    bq update --assignment --reservation_id=my_reservation --assignee_id=myproject --job_type=QUERY
    ```
- **Flex Slots:** Purchase via console or CLI for short-term needs.
    ```bash
    bq update --reservation --slots=500 --plan=FLEX my_flex_reservation
    ```
- **Monitoring:** Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA views and Monitoring dashboards to analyze slot usage and optimize allocation.

#### Interactive or Batch Query Jobs

**Concepts:**
- **Interactive Queries:** Executed immediately, returning results as soon as possible. Used for ad hoc analysis, dashboards, and user-driven exploration.
- **Batch Queries:** Queued and executed when resources are available, often at lower priority. Suitable for large, non-urgent workloads (e.g., nightly ETL, reporting).

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Interactive for:** Business-critical, low-latency, or user-facing queries.
- **Use Batch for:** Large, resource-intensive, or non-time-sensitive jobs.
- **Prioritize Workloads:** Assign critical jobs to dedicated reservations; run batch jobs in off-peak hours or with lower priority.
- **Cost Optimization:** Batch jobs can be scheduled during periods of lower demand to maximize slot utilization.
- **Monitoring and SLAs:** Track job completion times and set alerts for missed deadlines.

**GCP Implementation:**
- **Submitting Interactive Queries:** Default mode in BigQuery UI, CLI, or API.
    ```bash
    bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT ...'
    ```
- **Submitting Batch Queries:** Specify batch priority.
    ```bash
    bq query --priority=BATCH 'SELECT ...'
    ```
- **Reservation Assignment:** Assign interactive and batch workloads to different reservations for isolation and performance guarantees.
- **Scheduling Batch Jobs:** Use Cloud Composer or Cloud Scheduler to automate batch query execution.
- **Monitoring:** Use BigQuery Job History, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS, and Monitoring for job tracking and alerting.
